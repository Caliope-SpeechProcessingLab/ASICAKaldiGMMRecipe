# This script is part of ASICAKaldiRecipe. It is used to measure how WER changes as
# the size of the training corpus increases. 
#
# Syntax is:
#    learningCurve.sh spkID  
#    Example: learningCurve.sh 002  

# In the present version, the spkIDs for learning are obtained as follows
# 	1) crossLearning.sh is called for spkID
# 	2) bestTest2.sh produces a list of speaker IDs ordered inversely to WER
#	3) ASICA is run n-1 times, each time adding a new set of training files 

# As in other scripts, Speaker IDs are recovered from the audio files as follows. 
# For files ----------------  the ID is ---
# 			CL001QL4_H45.wav 			001
# 			CL034QL4_H45.wav 			034
# etc.
# That is, it gets chars 3, 4 and 5
# If your speakers IDs are different from the above you will have to adapt the code.
# To facilitate this, you will find this comment where the code change is needed:

# ----	Check this if your IDs are different from above 

# The RESULTS will be found in results/learningCurve_spkID.txt
